# Set of simple macros


## Description
This is my set of simple macros that I use in my projects.


<br/>
## Usage

You need to include **simple_macros.h** file in your **.c** file.

```c
#include "simple_macros.h"    //use set of simple macros

//Then we can use the simple macros.
```

## Warning

If you want to use the atomic macros (ATOMIC_CMD_BIT or ATOMIC_CMD_FLAG) you have to add the file [atomic_arm.S](https://github.com/KoynovStas/atomic_arm/blob/master/atomic_arm.S) to your project.
